Podcast platform for Skywire 

Version 1.0 of Skycast is intended to be a simple platform serving Skycasts (Podcasts) accessible both from a standalone podcast application and a web interface. The content will be limited to audio and video podcasts but videos are not officially supported due to potential bandwidth issues. Videos will however be allowed. 

Users will be able to login, create channels, and upload content to their channels. Additionally of course anyone will be able to add these Skycast channels to their player or media (RSS, Podcast) management app as long as they have the Skycast app running in their local computer or device.
